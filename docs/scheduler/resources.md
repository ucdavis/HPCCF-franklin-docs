# Requesting Resources

## Resource Types

### CPUs / cores

CPUs are the central compute power behind your jobs.
Most scientific software supports multiprocessing (multiple instances of an executable with discrete memory resources,
possibly but not necessarily communicating with each other), multithreading (multiple paths, or threads, of execution
within a process on a node, sharing the same memory resources, but able to execute on different cores), or both.
This allows computation to scale with increased numbers of CPUs, allowing bigger datasets to be analyzed.

Slurm's CPU management methods are complex and can quickly become confusing.
For the purposes of this documentation, we will provide a simplified explanation; those with advanced needs
should consult [the Slurm documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html).

Slurm follows a distinction between its physically resources -- cluster nodes and CPUs or cores on a node -- and virtual
resources, or **tasks**, which specificy how requested physical resources will be grouped and distributed.
By default, Slurm will minimize the number of nodes allocated to a job, and attempt to keep the job's CPU requests
localized within a node.
**Tasks** group together CPUs (or other resources): CPUs within a task will be kept together on the same node.
Different tasks may end up on different nodes, but Slurm will exhaust the CPUs on a given node before splitting tasks between
nodes unless specifically requested.

!!! note "A Complication: SMT / Hyperthreading"

    Slurm understands the distinction between physical and logical cores.
    Most modern CPUs support [Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading),
    which allows multiple independent processes to run on a single
    physical core.
    Although each of these is not a *full fledged* core, they have independent hardware for certain operations, and can
    greatly improve scalability for some tasks.
    However, using an individual thread within a single core makes little sense, as it shares hardware with the other SMT threads
    on its core; so, Slurm will always keep these threads together.
    In practice, this means if you ask for an odd number of CPUs, your request will be rounded up so as not to split an SMT
    thread between different job allocations.

The primary parameters controlling these are:

- `--cpus-per-task/-c`: How many CPUs to request per task. The number of CPUs requested here will always be on the same node. By default, 1.
- `--ntasks/-n`: The number of tasks to request. By default, 1.
- `--nodes/-N`: The *minimum* number of nodes to request, by default, 1.

Let's explore some examples. The simple request would be to ask for 2 CPUs.
We will use `srun` to request resources and then immediately run the `nproc` command within the allocation
to report how many CPUs are available:

```slurm
$ srun -c 2 nproc 
srun: job 682 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 682 has been allocated resources
2
```

We asked for 2 CPUs per task, and Slurm gave us 2 CPUs and 1 task.
What happens if we ask for 2 tasks instead of 2 CPUs?

```slurm
$ srun -n 2 nproc
srun: job 683 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 683 has been allocated resources
1
1
```

This time, we were given 2 separate tasks, each of which got 1 CPU.
Each task ran its own instance of the `nproc` command, and so each reported `1`.
If we ask for more CPUs per task:

```slurm
$ srun -n 2 -c 2 nproc
srun: job 684 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 684 has been allocated resources
2
2
```

We still asked for 2 tasks, but this time we requested 2 CPUs in each.
So, we got 2 instances of `nproc`, each reported `2` CPUs in their task.

!!! abstract "Summary"

    If you want to run multithreaded jobs, use `--cpus-per-task N_THREADS` and `-ntasks 1`.
    If you want a multiprocess job (or an MPI job), increase `-ntasks`.

??? info "The SMT Edge Case"

    If we use `-c 1` without specifying the number of tasks, we might be taken by surprise:

    ```slurm
    $ srun -c 1 nproc     
    srun: job 685 queued and waiting for resources
    srun: job 685 has been allocated resources
    1
    1
    ```

    We only asked for 1 CPU per task, but we got 2 tasks! This is due to SMT, described in the note above.
    Because Slurm will not split SMT threads, and there are 2 SMT threads per physical core, the request
    was rounded up to 2 CPUs total.
    In order to keep with the 1 CPU-per-task constraint, it spawned 2 tasks. Similarly, if we specify
    that we only want 1 task, CPUs per task will instead be bumped:

    ```slurm
    $ srun -c 1 -n 1 nproc
    srun: job 686 queued and waiting for resources
    srun: job 686 has been allocated resources
    2
    ```

### Nodes

Let's explore multiple nodes a bit further.
We have seen previously that the `-n/ntasks` parameter will allocate discrete groups of cores.
In our prior examples, however, we used small resource requests.
What happens when we want to distribute jobs across nodes?

Slurm uses the [block distribution](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#OPT_block) method by default to distribute
tasks betwee nodes.
It will exhaust all the CPUs on a node with task groups before moving to a new node.
For these examples, we're going to create a script that reports both the hostname (ie, the node) and the number
of CPUs:

``` { .bash .copy title="host-nprocs.sh" }
#!/bin/bash

echo `hostname`: `nproc`
```

And make it executable with `#!bash chmod +x host-nprocs.sh`. 

Now let's make a multiple-task request:

```console
$ srun -c 2 -n 2 ./host-nprocs.sh
srun: job 691 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 691 has been allocated resources
c-8-42: 2
c-8-42: 2
```

As before, we asked for 2 tasks and 2 CPUs per task.
Both tasks were assigned to `c-8-42`, because it had enough CPUs to fulfill the request.
What if it did not?

```console
$ srun -c 120 -n 3 ./host-nprocs.sh
srun: job 692 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 692 has been allocated resources
c-8-42: 120
c-8-42: 120
c-8-50: 120
```

This time, we asked for 3 tasks each with 120 CPUs.
The first two tasks were able to be fulfilled by the node `c-8-42`, but that node did not have enough
CPUs to allocate another 120 on top of that.
So, the third task was distributed to `c-8-50`.
Thus, this task spanned multiple nodes.

Sometimes, we want to make sure each task has its own node.
We can achieve this with the `--nodes/-N` parameter.
This specifies the *minimum number of nodes* the tasks should be allocated across.
If we rerun the above example:

```console
$ srun -c 120 -n 3 -N 3 ./host-nprocs.sh
srun: job 693 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 693 has been allocated resources
c-8-42: 120
c-8-50: 120
c-8-58: 120
```

We still asked for 3 tasks and 3 CPUs per task, but this time we specified we wanted a minimum of 3 nodes.
As a result, we were allocated portions of `c-8-42`, `c-8-50`, and `c-8-58`.

### RAM / Memory

Random Access Memory (RAM) is the fast, volatile storage that your programs use to store data during execution.
This can be contrasted with disk storage, which is non-volatile and many orders of magnitude slower to access,
and is used for long term data -- say, your sequencing runs or cryo-EM images.
RAM is a limited resource on each node, so Slurm enforces memory limits for jobs using [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups).
If a job step consumes more RAM than requested, the step will be killed.

Some (mutually exclusive) parameters for requesting RAM are:

- `--mem`: The memory required *per-node*. Usually, you want to use `--mem-per-cpu`.
- `--mem-per-cpu`: The memory required *per CPU or core*. If you requested $N$ tasks, $C$ CPUs per task, and $M$ memory per CPU, your total memory usage will be $N * C * M$. Note that, if $N \gt 1$, you will have $N$ discrete $C * M$-sized chunks of RAM requested, possibly across different nodes.
- `--mem-per-gpu`: Memory required *per GPU*, which will scale with GPUs in the same way as `--mem-per-cpu` will with CPUs.

For all memory requests, units can be specified explicitly with the suffixes `[K|M|G|T]` for `[kilobytes|megabytes|gigabytes|terabytes]`,
with the default units being `M`/`megabytes`.
So, `--mem-per-cpu=500` will requested 500 megabytes of RAM per CPU, and `--mem-per-cpu=32G` will request 32 gigabytes
of RAM per CPU.

Here is an example of a task overrunning its memory allocation.
We will use the `stress-ng` program to allocate 8 gigabytes of RAM in a job that only requested 200 megabytes.

```console
$ srun -n 1 --cpus-per-task 2 --mem-per-cpu 200M stress-ng -m 1 --vm-bytes 8G --oomable         1 ↵
srun: job 706 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 706 has been allocated resources
stress-ng: info:  [3037475] defaulting to a 86400 second (1 day, 0.00 secs) run per stressor

stress-ng: info:  [3037475] successful run completed in 2.23s
slurmstepd: error: Detected 1 oom-kill event(s) in StepId=706.0. Some of your processes may have been killed by the cgroup out-of-memory handler.
srun: error: c-8-42: task 0: Out Of Memory
